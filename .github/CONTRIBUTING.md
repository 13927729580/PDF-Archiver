# Contributing to PDF Archiver

All contributions are welcome to **PDF Archiver**!

Here are some example topics:

* Writing some more documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/JulianKahnert/PDF-Archiver/wiki).
* Propose solutions for [Issues](https://github.com/JulianKahnert/PDF-Archiver/issues).
* Since I am no web developer, help with e.g. GitHub pages would be awesome!

If you have other ideas, just send me a [mail](mailto:PDF-Archiver@juliankahnert.de?subject=Contributing)!
